# /watch

**Give Claude the ability to watch any video.**

Claude Code (recommended — auto-updates via marketplace):
```
/plugin marketplace add bradautomates/claude-video
/plugin install watch@claude-video
```

Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, or any of 50+ [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) hosts:
```bash
npx skills add bradautomates/claude-video -g
```
(`-g` installs globally for your user, available across all projects. Drop it to scope per-project.)

More install options (claude.ai web, manual) in the [Install](#install) section below.

Zero config to start — `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` install on first run via `brew` on macOS (Linux/Windows print exact commands). Captions cover most public videos for free. Whisper API key is only needed when a video has no captions.

---

Claude can read a webpage, run a script, browse a repo. What it can't do, out of the box, is *watch a video*. You paste a YouTube link and it has to either guess from the title or pull a transcript that's missing 90% of what's on screen.

With Claude Video `/watch` you can paste a URL or a local path, ask a question, and Claude fetches captions first, downloads only what it needs, extracts frames (scene-aware, or fast keyframes at `efficient` detail), pulls a timestamped transcript (free captions when available, Whisper API as fallback), and `Read`s every frame as an image. By the time it answers, it has *seen* the video and *heard* the audio.

```
/watch https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ what happens at the 30 second mark?
```

## What people actually use it for

**Analyze someone else's content.** `/watch https://youtu.be/<viral-video> what hook did they open with?` Claude looks at the first frames, reads the opening transcript, breaks down the structure. Same for ad creative, competitor launches, podcast intros, anything where the *how* matters as much as the *what*.

**Diagnose a bug from a video.** Someone sends you a screen recording of something broken. `/watch bug-repro.mov what's going wrong?` Claude watches the recording, finds the frame where the issue appears, describes what's on screen, often catches the cause without you ever opening the file.

**Summarize a video.** `/watch https://youtu.be/<long-thing> summarize this` does the obvious thing — pulls the structure, the key moments, what was actually said and shown. Faster than watching at 2x.

**Cut the hype out of an update video.** `/watch https://youtu.be/<launch-video> what's actually new — skip the hype` Strip a "game-changer" feature drop down to the few things that matter, so you get the substance without ten minutes of intro and overselling.

**Turn a playlist into notes.** `/watch https://youtu.be/<video> summarize this to a note` Run it across a series and file a per-video summary, so a channel or course becomes a searchable set of notes instead of hours you have to sit through.

## How it works

1. **You paste a video and a question.** URL (anything yt-dlp supports — YouTube, Loom, TikTok, X, Instagram, plus a few hundred more) or a local path (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm`).
2. **`yt-dlp` checks captions first.** At `transcript` detail, captioned URLs return without downloading video. Otherwise, or when Whisper needs audio, it downloads only what the run needs.
3. **`ffmpeg` extracts frames at the chosen detail.** `efficient` decodes keyframes only (near-instant); `balanced`/`token-burner` prefer scene-change frames and fall back to the duration-aware uniform sampler when they under-produce. JPEGs are 512px wide by default and clamped to 1998px tall for Claude Read compatibility.
4. **The transcript comes from one of two places.** First try: `yt-dlp` pulls native captions (manual or auto-generated) from the source. Free, instant, accurate-ish. Fallback: extract a mono 16 kHz 64 kbps mp3 audio clip (~480 kB/min) and ship it to Whisper — Groq's `whisper-large-v3` (preferred — cheaper and faster) or OpenAI's `whisper-1`.
5. **Frames + transcript are handed to Claude.** The script prints frame paths with `t=MM:SS` markers and the transcript with timestamps. Claude `Read`s each frame in parallel — JPEGs render directly as images in its context.
6. **Claude answers grounded in what's actually on screen and in the audio.** Not "based on the description" or "according to the title." It saw the frames. It heard the transcript. It answers the way someone who watched the video would.
7. **Cleanup.** The script prints a working directory at the end. If you're not asking follow-ups, Claude removes it.

## Frame budget — why it matters

Token cost is dominated by frames. Every frame is an image; image tokens add up fast. The script's auto-fps logic exists so you don't blow your context budget on a sparse scan of a 30-minute video that would have been better answered by a focused 30-second window.

| Duration | Default frame budget | What you get |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| ≤30 s | ~30 frames | Dense — basically every key moment |
| 30 s - 1 min | ~40 frames | Still dense |
| 1 - 3 min | ~60 frames | Comfortable |
| 3 - 10 min | ~80 frames | Sparse but workable |
| > 10 min | 100 frames (capped modes) | "Sparse scan" warning — re-run focused, or `--detail token-burner` for full uncapped coverage |

When the user names a moment ("around 2:30", "the last 30 seconds", "from 0:45 to 1:00"), pass `--start` / `--end`. Focused mode gets denser per-second budgets, capped at 2 fps. Far more useful than a sparse pass over the whole thing.

## Frame deduplication

Frame selection — keyframes (`efficient`), scene-change detection (`balanced`/`token-burner`), or the uniform sampler it falls back to — can still surface near-identical frames: a screen recording that holds one slide for 90 seconds produces a dozen, each billed as a separate image. A dedup pass drops them before frames reach Claude. It runs by default on every frame mode (`--no-dedup` turns it off):

1. One `ffmpeg` call scales each extracted JPEG to a 16×16 grayscale thumbnail. Everything after is pure-stdlib Python — no image libraries.
2. For each frame, compute the **mean absolute difference** against the *last frame that was kept* (average per-pixel brightness change, 0–255 scale).
3. If that difference is at or below the threshold (`2.0`), the frame is a near-duplicate and is dropped. Otherwise it's kept and becomes the new reference.
4. The frame-budget cap applies *after* dedup, so the budget is spent on distinct frames.

Comparing against the last *kept* frame (not the previous one) catches slow fades that never trip a frame-to-frame threshold. The threshold is deliberately low and measures absolute brightness rather than structure, so a one-line code diff, a terminal scrolling a row, or two differently-colored flat slides all survive.

The **Frames** line reports what was collapsed, e.g. `6 selected from 14 candidates (… 8 near-duplicates dropped …)`. On always-moving footage nothing is dropped and you pay what you would have anyway.

## Detail modes — measured

The `--detail` dial trades speed and token cost for visual fidelity. Numbers below are from a real run against a **49:08** YouTube video (1280×720, English auto-captions) — a long, mostly-static screen recording, the case that stresses the caps hardest. Extraction times are local CPU against a pre-downloaded copy; the one-time download was **~37 s** / 76 MB, shared by the three frame modes.

| Mode | Engine | Frames | Cap | Extraction time | Temporal coverage | Est. image tokens |
|------|--------|--------|-----|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `transcript` | none (captions) | 0 | — | **~4.5 s** (one yt-dlp call, no download) | full (text) | 0 (≈26.6k text tokens) |
| `efficient` | keyframe (`-skip_frame nokey`) | 50 | 50 | **~0.5 s** | 0:00 → 49:04 (full) | **~9.8k** |
| `balanced` | scene-change | 100 | 100 | **~20.9 s** | 0:00 → 48:38 (full) | **~19.7k** |
| `token-burner` | scene-change | 116 | uncapped | **~21.0 s** | 0:00 → 48:38 (full) | **~22.8k** |

- **Image tokens** use Anthropic's `(width × height) / 750` — at the default 512px width these 720p frames are 512×288, **≈197 tokens/frame**; `--resolution 1024` roughly 4×s that. The transcript is surfaced in every captioned mode and on long videos is often the larger cost.
- **One sampling rule across frame modes.** Each detects all candidates across the full range, then even-samples (first + last always kept) down to its cap. The modes differ only in candidate *source* (keyframes vs. scene cuts) and cap, never in how coverage is spread — so the last frame always lands at the end, not partway through.
- **`efficient` is the speed tier** (~0.5 s) — it only reconstructs keyframes, so it's ~40× faster than the scene modes, which decode every frame to find cuts. It can also return *more* frames than `balanced` on low-motion footage (keyframes outnumber scene cuts); "efficient" means fast extraction, not fewer frames.
- **`token-burner` only diverges from `balanced` past the cap.** This clip had 116 cuts, so `balanced` sampled 100 and `token-burner` kept all 116. On high-motion video with hundreds of cuts, `token-burner` keeps everything (and trips the >250-frame token warning) while `balanced` thins to 100.

End-to-end from a cold URL, `transcript` is the cheapest mode by far; the frame modes add the shared ~37 s download on top of the extraction times above.

## Install

| Surface | Install |
|---------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add bradautomates/claude-video` then `/plugin install watch@claude-video` |
| **Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, +50 more** | `npx skills add bradautomates/claude-video -g` |
| **claude.ai** (web) | [Download `watch.skill`](https://github.com/bradautomates/claude-video/releases/latest) → Settings → Capabilities → Skills → `+` |
| **Manual / dev** | `git clone` then symlink `skills/watch` into your host's skills dir (see below) |

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add bradautomates/claude-video
/plugin install watch@claude-video
```

Update later with `/plugin update watch@claude-video`.

### Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and 50+ other hosts

The [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) CLI installs the skill into whatever agents it detects:

```bash
npx skills add bradautomates/claude-video -g
```

`-g` installs globally for your user (`~/.codex/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, etc.); drop it to install into the current project instead. Useful flags:

- `-a, --agent <names…>` — target specific hosts, e.g. `-a codex -a cursor`
- `-l, --list` — list the skills in this repo without installing
- `--copy` — copy files instead of symlinking (for filesystems without symlink support)

The CLI discovers the skill from `skills/watch/SKILL.md` and copies the whole folder — `SKILL.md` plus its `scripts/` runtime — as a self-contained unit. `SKILL.md` resolves its own scripts relative to wherever it was installed, so it works the same on every host.

Update later with `npx skills update watch -g`.

### claude.ai (web)

1. [Download `watch.skill`](https://github.com/bradautomates/claude-video/releases/latest) from the latest release.
2. Go to Settings → Capabilities → Skills.
3. Click `+` and drop the file in.

Enable "Code execution and file creation" under Capabilities first — the skill shells out to `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`, so it won't run without it.

### Manual (developer)

Clone the repo and symlink the self-contained skill folder into your host's skills directory — the symlink keeps the install in sync with your working tree as you edit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradautomates/claude-video.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/claude-video/skills/watch" ~/.claude/skills/watch   # or ~/.codex/skills/watch
```

For claude.ai, build the `.skill` bundle from source: `bash skills/watch/scripts/build-skill.sh` produces `dist/watch.skill`.

## First run

On the first `/watch` call, the skill runs `scripts/setup.py --check`. If `ffmpeg` / `yt-dlp` aren't on your PATH, or no Whisper API key is set, it walks you through fixing it:

- **macOS** — auto-runs `brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp`.
- **Linux** — prints the exact `apt` / `dnf` / `pipx` commands.
- **Windows** — prints the `winget` / `pip` commands.
- **API key** — scaffolds `~/.config/watch/.env` (mode `0600`) with commented placeholders for `GROQ_API_KEY` (preferred) and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

After setup, preflight is silent and `/watch` just works. The check is a sub-100ms lookup, so it doesn't slow you down on subsequent runs.

## Bring your own keys

Captions cover the majority of public videos for free. The Whisper fallback only kicks in when a video genuinely has no caption track — typically local files, TikToks, some Vimeos, and the occasional caption-less YouTube upload.

| Capability | What you need | Cost |
|------------|---------------|------|
| Download + native captions | `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` | Free |
| Whisper fallback (preferred) | [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) — `whisper-large-v3` | Cheap, fast |
| Whisper fallback (alt) | [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — `whisper-1` | Standard pricing |
| Whisper fallback (self-hosted) | `WHISPER_BASE_URL` → any OpenAI-compatible server | Free, private, offline |
| Disable Whisper entirely | `--no-whisper` | Free, frames-only when no captions |

### Self-hosted / local Whisper

Set `WHISPER_BASE_URL` (in the environment or `~/.config/watch/.env`) to point `watch` at
any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint instead of a cloud provider —
audio then never leaves your machine, and there is no API key, rate limit, or per-minute cost.

```bash
# ~/.config/watch/.env
WHISPER_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8178/v1
```

No API key is required when `WHISPER_BASE_URL` is set (most self-hosted servers need no
auth). If yours does, set `WHISPER_API_KEY`. To send a specific model name, set
`WHISPER_MODEL`. Progress output reports the actual host (`local`, or the hostname) rather
than naming a cloud provider it isn't using.

A local server that works out of the box is [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp)'s
bundled `whisper-server`, which can serve the OpenAI route directly:

```bash
brew install whisper-cpp
whisper-server -m ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8178 \
  --inference-path /v1/audio/transcriptions --convert
```

Leaving `WHISPER_BASE_URL` unset preserves the existing hosted behavior exactly.

## Usage

```
/watch https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ what happens at the 30 second mark?
/watch https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123 summarize this
/watch ~/Movies/screen-recording.mp4 when does the UI break?
/watch https://vimeo.com/123 what tools does she mention?
```

Focused on a specific section — denser frame budget, lower token cost:
```
/watch https://youtu.be/abc --start 2:15 --end 2:45
/watch video.mp4 --start 50 --end 60
/watch "$URL" --start 1:12:00            # from 1h12m to end
```

Other knobs (passed to `scripts/watch.py`):

- `--detail transcript|efficient|balanced|token-burner` — fidelity/speed dial. `transcript` skips frames (transcript only); `efficient` uses fast keyframes (cap 50); `balanced` uses scene-aware frames (cap 100); `token-burner` is scene-aware and uncapped.
- `--timestamps T1,T2,…` — grab a frame at each absolute timestamp (`SS`/`MM:SS`/`HH:MM:SS`). Claude reads the transcript first, then targets the moments the presenter flags ("look here", "as you can see"). Added on top of the detail frames (reserved against the cap); out-of-window cues are dropped in focus mode; with `--detail transcript` these become the only frames.
- `--max-frames N` — lower the frame cap for a tighter token budget.
- `--resolution W` — bump frame width to 1024 px when Claude needs to read on-screen text (slides, terminals, code).
- `--fps F` — override the auto-fps calculation (still capped at 2 fps).
- `--whisper groq|openai` — force a specific Whisper backend.
- `--no-whisper` — disable transcription entirely; frames only.
- `--no-dedup` — keep near-duplicate frames. By default a frame-delta pass drops frames that are visually near-identical to the one before them (held slides, static screen recordings, paused video), so the frame budget is spent on distinct content; this flag turns that off.
- `--out-dir DIR` — keep working files somewhere specific (default: auto-generated tmp dir).

## Limits

- **Long-video accuracy depends on the detail mode.** On the capped modes (`efficient`, default `balanced`) coverage thins out past ~10 minutes — the frame cap spreads across the whole clip, so the script prints a "sparse scan" warning and you're better off re-running focused with `--start`/`--end`. `token-burner` lifts the cap and keeps *every* scene-change frame across the full video, so it stays complete on longer clips at the cost of more image tokens. The 10-minute mark is guidance for the capped modes, not a hard ceiling.
- **Detail is one dial.** Defaults are balanced: scene-aware frames, 2 fps max, 100-frame cap. Use `--detail efficient` for a fast 50-frame keyframe pass, or `--detail token-burner` for uncapped scene candidates. Set `WATCH_DETAIL` in `~/.config/watch/.env` to change the default.
